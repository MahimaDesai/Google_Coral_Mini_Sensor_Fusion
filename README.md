# Google_Coral_Mini_Sensor_Fusion

The project's aim is to demonstrate the application of sensor fusion using the Google Coral Dev Board Mini. The focus is on quickly prototyping on-device ML for object detection, and carbon monoxide sensor threshold detection. 
Initially, the Environmental Sensor Board from Coral was intended for sensor fusion, but extensive testing and manufacturer guidelines, along with online resources, indicated that it is incompatible with the Dev Board Mini from Coral. So, an external circuitry is being using used for carbon monoxide sensor connection.
The type of sensor fusion implemented here is Decision Level sensor fusion.
